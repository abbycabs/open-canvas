# Open Canvas

Hello! This is a tool for editing and viewing Open Canvas online.

## This is a prototype

Things won't work sometimes! Like right now.

## Under the hood

Building off of @flukeout's work on [mozilla club events](https://github.com/mozilla/clubs-events) and @blahah & @joeyklee's first pass at an [online editable Open Canvas](https://mozillascience.github.io/working-open-workshop/open_canvas/). This uses google forms + sheetsu to store the finished canvases!
